## Problem:
* only owner should be able to send transactions
* user should not enter their private key due to privacy concerns

## My approach:
* made it so that to view the balance, use public key
* in order to send transaction, owner have to input the signature
  * signature made by using their private key, amount they are sending, and receipient public address
* thus making it possible for only the owner to make transactions without revealing their private key

## Testing:
private key : e688c853879be40d46f25e3dcf0899161a75c306a4744bcd930ebdc98f160154<br>

balance : 100<br>

private key : 909ccd7853c09e23284c56c22e07e39d9c09293ce06431c4710d3570ab49de13<br>

balance : 50<br>

private key : 503ee9bebd22810b380d5b7e48c94989811dc9447fd9f1a8a5828dc11f8db056<br>

balance : 75 <br>

can retrieve signature from /Tools for testing purposes
